<h1><center>Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning & Developing Web App By Deploying The Built ML Model </center></h1>

## About 
Water pollution is a pressing global issue, significantly impacting public health and ecosystems. 
Accurate prediction of water quality is crucial for effective monitoring, prevention, and remediation efforts.
This project aims to develop a web application that employs machine learning algorithms to predict water quality based on various parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and conductivity. 
The application will provide a user-friendly interface for data input and visualization of predicted water quality.

## Features

#### Water Quality Features:
Key attributes like pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), and temperature are used as input features for the machine learning model.

#### Machine Learning Model Selection:
Algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks are implemented to analyze patterns in the water quality data and predict the water's status (e.g., safe, polluted).

#### Model Deployment in Web App:
A user-friendly web application is developed using frameworks like Flask or Django to enable users to input water quality parameters and receive real-time predictions on water quality.

#### Visualization and Reporting:
Interactive visualizations (using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib) and downloadable reports provide insights into water quality trends, making the tool informative and actionable for users.
